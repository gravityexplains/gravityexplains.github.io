        <p class="subtitle">
            A beginner-friendly guide to planets, orbits, gravity, and formation.

        <h2>What is the Solar System?</h2>
        <p>
            The Solar System is a gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun,
            eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.
            All these objects orbit the Sun due to its strong gravitational pull.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Sun:</strong> A massive star at the center of the Solar System.</li>
            <li><strong>Planets:</strong> Eight bodies that orbit the Sun.</li>
            <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Natural satellites orbiting planets.</li>
            <li><strong>Asteroids:</strong> Rocky objects mostly found between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
            <li><strong>Comets:</strong> Icy bodies with glowing tails when near the Sun.</li>
            <li><strong>Kuiper Belt & Oort Cloud:</strong> Regions beyond Neptune.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Don’t Planets Fall Into the Sun?</h2>
        <p>
            Planets move forward through space while the Sun’s gravity pulls them inward.
            This balance causes planets to follow curved paths called orbits instead of
            falling straight into the Sun.
