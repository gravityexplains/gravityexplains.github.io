    <h2>What is the Solar System?</h2>
    <p>
        The Solar System is a gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun,
        eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.
        All these objects orbit the Sun due to its strong gravitational pull.

    <h2>Main Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Sun:</strong> A massive star at the center of the Solar System.</li>
        <li><strong>Planets:</strong> Eight bodies that orbit the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Natural satellites orbiting planets.</li>
        <li><strong>Asteroids:</strong> Rocky objects mostly found between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
        <li><strong>Comets:</strong> Icy bodies with glowing tails when near the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Kuiper Belt & Oort Cloud:</strong> Regions beyond Neptune containing icy objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Don’t Planets Fall Into the Sun?</h2>
    <p>
        Planets move forward through space while the Sun’s gravity pulls them inward.
        This balance causes planets to follow curved paths called orbits instead of
        falling straight into the Sun.
