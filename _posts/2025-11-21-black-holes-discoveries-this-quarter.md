Black holes appear mysterious and somewhat scary whenever we hear of them. The reason is mainly because we can’t see what’s inside. However, looking at their surroundings, we can learn a lot about how black holes affect the things around them. For example, **‘Black Hole Spaghettification’** is one such interesting phenomenon where the black hole’s gravity stretches things out like a yummy spaghetti!

Then there are swirling disks of matter around the border of black holes. These are called **accretion disks** and form a beautiful ring-like structure, as you might have seen in movies like *Interstellar*. Probably, the most famous mystery is figuring out **why light can’t escape black holes**. These riddles lead us to the concept of a **singularity**, where matter is crushed to an infinitely small point at the centre of a black hole.

Join in to explore the latest discoveries in research which will help to solve the mysteries of the Universe!

# Biggest Stellar-Mass Black Hole Discovered in Our Galaxy!

Introducing the latest astronomical discovery: Astronomers have revealed the most massive stellar-mass black hole ever detected in our Galaxy. Named **Gaia BH3**, it’s **33 times heavier than our Sun**, making the previously known **Cygnus X-1**, at 21 solar masses, seem small in comparison.

The detection was made using data from the **Gaia spacecraft**, which maps the position and movements of stars in the Milky Way. A slight irregularity, or wobble, was noticed in the orbit of a nearby star, indicating the presence of an unseen companion — likely a black hole — exerting gravitational influence.

Follow-up observations with the **Very Large Telescope in Chile** confirmed the black hole’s existence and provided details about its mass. This black hole, located **2,000 light years from Earth** in the constellation Aquila, is the second-closest one to our planet.

Additionally, the star orbiting the black hole is deficient in heavy elements, supporting the theory that smaller black holes can arise from stars that didn’t undergo as much nuclear fusion. Further research promises to deepen our understanding of black hole formation.

The groundbreaking finding, published in the journal *Astronomy and Astrophysics* on **16th April 2024**, lets us know more about the cosmic landscape and brings us closer to understanding black hole formation and distribution in the Milky Way.

# Brand New Picture of Our Friendly Neighbourhood Black Hole: Sagittarius A*

In another of our recent cosmic breakthroughs, scientists have used **polarized light** to capture the first-ever image of our Galaxy’s massive black hole — **Sagittarius A\***.

Hidden by thick clouds of dust and stars, this difficult yet impressive task was made possible by the **Event Horizon Telescope**, which previously gave us the first direct image of a supermassive black hole in 2019. This amazing insights discovery, published on **27th March 2024** in *The Astrophysical Journal Letters*, gives exciting new insight into black holes.

This polarized light image reveals **organized magnetic fields** swirling around the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A\*, suggesting commonality in black hole magnetic structure and hinting at a **concealed jet**, similar to the black hole in the M87 galaxy.

# The Giant Consumer

Australian scientists have found a supermassive black hole that **devours one Sun every day** and is whopping **17 billion times heavier than our Sun**. This discovery, detailed in the *Nature Astronomy* journal, unveils the **fastest-growing black hole ever seen**.

Named **J059-4351**, it’s now known as the **brightest object in the Universe**, shining **500 trillion times brighter than our Sun** and located **12 billion light years away**.

With an accretion disk **seven light years wide** and temperatures soaring to **10,000°C**, it resembles a massive storm cell. These temperatures are proving to be just as mind (and light)-bending as in sci-fi movies, showing the immense power of black holes and their astonishing role in shaping the cosmos.

# The Most Massive Known Supermassive Black Hole: TON 618

Mexican astronomers Braulio Iriarte and Enrique Chavira first catalogued **TON 618** in 1957 as a faint blue star during a survey at the Tonantzintla Observatory in Mexico. They listed the object as number 618 after it appeared ‘decidedly violet’ on photographic plates.

Later, in 1970, radio astronomers in Bologna, Italy discovered radio emissions from TON 618, indicating it was a **quasar**. Marie-Helene Ulrich then obtained optical spectra of TON 618 at the McDonald Observatory which showed emission lines typical of a quasar. From the high redshift of the lines Ulrich deduced that TON 618 was very distant, and hence was one of the most luminous quasars known.

As a quasar, TON 618 is believed to be the **active galactic nucleus** at the centre of a galaxy, the engine of which is a **supermassive black hole** feeding on intensely hot gas and matter in an accretion disc. TON 618 lies some **18.2 billion light years** from Earth, in the constellation **Canes Venatici**.

Its mass is a whopping **66 billion times the mass of our Sun!** Making it one of the biggest and largest black holes ever discovered.

# Time Near TON 618 — How Much Passes on Earth?

What does one minute feel like near the roaring accretion disk of a monster like TON 618? Surprisingly — not that different. At a few Schwarzschild radii the clock near the disk only runs tens of percent slower than on Earth, not days or years.

Using the Schwarzschild (non-rotating) time-dilation formula gives a simple, conservative estimate of how time near a black hole compares with time far away (Earth).

If an observer close to the disk measures a proper time **τ**, a distant observer measures:

\[
t = \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 - 1/k}}
\]

where **k = r/rₛ** is the radius in units of the Schwarzschild radius.

Because the mass cancels out, these numbers are the same for any black hole at the same multiple of rₛ.

For example:

- 1 minute measured at the Schwarzschild **ISCO (≈3rₛ)** appears as **1.225 minutes** to Earth (≈73.5 s ≈ 0.00085 days).  
- At **k = 6**, it’s **1.095 min** (≈65.7 s ≈ 0.00076 days).  
- At **k = 10**, **1.054 min** (≈63.2 s ≈ 0.00073 days).  
- At **k = 100**, **1.005 min** (≈60.3 s ≈ 0.00070 days).

Big time-stretching (minutes → years) only happens if you sit **extremely close to the horizon** (i.e., r approaches rₛ), or for special **Kerr prograde orbits** allowed by fast spin.

# Conclusion

At the end of the day, TON 618 doesn’t need sci-fi time tricks to impress. Even its “normal” physics is insane. A place where minutes slip, gravity wins, and the universe quietly flexes. If this is what one black hole can do, imagine what else is out there.
