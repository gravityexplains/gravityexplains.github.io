    <h1>Black Holes: Discoveries This Quarter</h1>
    <p>Exploring the latest breakthroughs that bring us closer to understanding the most mysterious objects in the Universe.</p>

        <p>
            Black holes appear mysterious and somewhat scary whenever we hear of them. The main reason for this is because we can’t see what’s inside. However, by observing their surroundings, astronomers can learn a great deal about how black holes affect nearby matter and space-time itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phenomena such as <strong>black hole spaghettification</strong> demonstrate how extreme gravity stretches objects into long, thin shapes—much like spaghetti. Surrounding many black holes are swirling disks of hot gas known as <strong>accretion disks</strong>, forming brilliant ring-like structures often depicted in movies such as <em>Interstellar</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the greatest mysteries remains why light cannot escape a black hole. This leads to the idea of a <strong>singularity</strong>, a point at the centre where matter is compressed into an infinitely dense state. Let us explore recent discoveries that are helping scientists unravel these cosmic mysteries.

        <h2>Biggest Stellar-Mass Black Hole in the Milky Way</h2>
        <p>
            Astronomers have identified the most massive stellar-mass black hole ever detected in our galaxy. Named <strong>Gaia BH3</strong>, this object has a mass about <strong>33 times that of the Sun</strong>, surpassing the previous record-holder, Cygnus X-1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discovery was made using data from the <strong>Gaia spacecraft</strong>, which precisely tracks the positions and motions of stars in the Milky Way. A subtle wobble in a nearby star’s orbit revealed the gravitational pull of an unseen companion—likely a black hole.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            Follow-up observations with the <strong>Very Large Telescope</strong> in Chile confirmed Gaia BH3’s mass and nature. Located about <strong>2,000 light years away</strong> in the constellation Aquila, it is the second-closest known black hole to Earth.
        </div>
        <p>
            Interestingly, the companion star lacks heavy elements, supporting theories that massive black holes can form from stars with limited nuclear fusion. Published on <strong>16 April 2024</strong> in <em>Astronomy & Astrophysics</em>, this discovery enhances our understanding of black hole formation in the Milky Way.

        <h2>Sagittarius A*: Our Galactic Neighbour</h2>
        <p>
            Scientists have captured the first-ever polarized image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy—<strong>Sagittarius A*</strong>. Hidden behind dense clouds of dust and stars, this image was produced using the <strong>Event Horizon Telescope</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Polarized light reveals structured magnetic fields swirling around the black hole, suggesting similarities between Sagittarius A* and the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            These observations hint at the presence of a concealed jet and provide valuable insights into how magnetic fields shape black hole behaviour. The results were published on <strong>27 March 2024</strong> in <em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.

        <h2>The Giant Consumer</h2>
        <p>
            Australian astronomers have identified a supermassive black hole that consumes the equivalent of <strong>one Sun every day</strong>. Known as <strong>J059-4351</strong>, it is an astonishing <strong>17 billion times more massive than the Sun</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Located around <strong>12 billion light years away</strong>, this black hole is the brightest object ever observed, shining <strong>500 trillion times brighter than our Sun</strong>. Its accretion disk spans seven light years and reaches temperatures of nearly <strong>10,000°C</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These extreme properties showcase the incredible power of black holes and their role in shaping galaxies across cosmic history.

        <h2>TON 618: The Most Massive Known Black Hole</h2>
        <p>
            First catalogued in 1957 at the Tonantzintla Observatory in Mexico, <strong>TON 618</strong> was initially thought to be a faint blue star. Later radio and optical observations revealed it to be a distant and extremely luminous quasar.
        </p>
        <p>
            TON 618 is believed to host a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of <strong>66 billion Suns</strong>, making it one of the largest black holes ever discovered. It lies approximately <strong>18.2 billion light years</strong> away in the constellation Canes Venatici.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            Despite its immense mass, time dilation near its accretion disk is surprisingly modest. At several Schwarzschild radii, a minute near the black hole corresponds to just over a minute on Earth. Extreme time stretching occurs only very close to the event horizon or in special rotating (Kerr) orbits.
        </div>
        <p>
            TON 618 demonstrates that even without science-fiction exaggeration, real black hole physics is extraordinary.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Black holes like TON 618 do not need cinematic effects to impress. Their genuine physics—where gravity dominates, time subtly shifts, and matter glows intensely—already stretches the limits of human imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            If one black hole can display such extremes, the universe surely holds many more surprises waiting to be discovered.
