    <h1>Quasars: The Brightest Beacons of the Universe</h1>
    <p><em>Published: November 2025</em></p>

    <p>
        Quasars are among the most powerful and mysterious objects ever discovered. 
        They shine brighter than entire galaxies, appear as brilliant points of light from billions of light-years away, 
        and are powered by something we cannot even see — a supermassive black hole.

    <h2>⭐ What Exactly Is a Quasar?</h2>
    <p>
        A quasar forms when a <strong>supermassive black hole</strong> at the center of a galaxy becomes active and starts 
        devouring massive amounts of gas, dust, and stars. As this material spirals into the black hole, it heats up to 
        millions of degrees and glows intensely — brighter than any other known object in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite their extreme brightness, the black hole itself remains invisible. The light comes from the 
        <strong>accretion disk</strong> — the swirling, superheated matter falling inward.
    </p>

    <h2>⭐ Why Are Quasars So Bright?</h2>
    <p>Quasars are powered by the most efficient energy source known:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The accretion disk reaches temperatures of <strong>millions of degrees</strong>.</li>
        <li>Friction and gravity convert matter directly into energy.</li>
        <li>They emit light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum — radio, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray.</li>
        <li>Some quasars launch <strong>relativistic jets</strong> that stretch millions of light-years.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At their peak, a single quasar can outshine an entire galaxy containing <strong>100–400 billion stars</strong>.</p>

    <h2>⭐ The Monster Black Holes Inside Quasars</h2>
    <p>
        A quasar’s heart is a supermassive black hole typically ranging from <strong>100 million</strong> to over 
        <strong>60 billion solar masses</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>TON 618 is the most extreme example — a quasar powered by a black hole over <strong>66 billion</strong> times the mass of the Sun.</p>

    <h2>⭐ How Far Away Are Quasars?</h2>
    <p>
        Most quasars are located <strong>billions of light-years</strong> away. This means we see them as they were 
        in the early universe — sometimes less than a billion years after the Big Bang.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of this, quasars are cosmic time machines that help astronomers study how the first galaxies and black holes formed.
    </p>

    <h2>⭐ How Do Astronomers Detect Quasars?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Telescopes</strong> detect their powerful emissions across multiple wavelengths.</li>
        <li><strong>Spectroscopy</strong> reveals huge redshifts, indicating extreme distances.</li>
        <li><strong>Radio telescopes</strong> map their enormous jets.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrared telescopes</strong> like JWST help find the earliest quasars in the universe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⭐ Fun Facts About Quasars</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A single quasar can be <strong>1000 times brighter</strong> than the Milky Way.</li>
        <li>Some quasar jets move at <strong>99% the speed of light</strong>.</li>
        <li>Quasars flicker — their brightness changes over days or even hours.</li>
        <li>The first quasars were discovered because their light looked “star-like” but had impossible spectral lines.</li>
        <li>When we look at quasars, we're literally looking <strong>back in time</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⭐ Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Quasars are cosmic powerhouses — the brightest beacons in the universe, powered by the 
        unstoppable hunger of supermassive black holes. They light up the distant cosmos, tell the story 
        of early galaxies, and reveal how extreme our universe can truly be.
