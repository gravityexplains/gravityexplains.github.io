    <h2>Why Neutron Stars Matter</h2>
    <p>
        Neutron stars are the dense, collapsed cores left behind after massive stars explode as supernovae. 
        They are among the most extreme and fascinating objects in the universe, packing more mass than the Sun 
        into a sphere only about 20 kilometers wide.
    </p>

    <h2>Significance in Astrophysics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Testing extreme physics:</strong> They allow scientists to study matter under pressures and densities impossible to recreate on Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational wave sources:</strong> Neutron star mergers have been detected through gravitational waves, providing insights into spacetime and relativity.</li>
        <li><strong>Birthplace of heavy elements:</strong> Gold, platinum, and many heavy elements are created when neutron stars collide.</li>
        <li><strong>Pulsars:</strong> Spinning neutron stars emit precise radio pulses that help map the galaxy and test general relativity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Topic Matters For Students</h2>
    <p>
        Neutron stars connect many fields—nuclear physics, relativity, high-energy astrophysics, 
        and cosmic evolution. Studying them demonstrates strong theoretical understanding and 
        scientific curiosity, which are crucial for future astrophysics research.
